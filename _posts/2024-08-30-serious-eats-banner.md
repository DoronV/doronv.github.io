So I'm someone who likes to cook, and one of my favorite sites for recipes and inspiration is [Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com). However, for a while their cookie consent banner has been broken on Firefox.
Doesn't matter if you approve or decline the cookies, the banner stays up, and doesn't allow you to scroll down and read the article. Luckily it's easy to remove the banner through the Dev Console, but of course that' a hassle. So I created an
extension that just removes the banner, and restores functionality to the site.
You can check it out at the [Firefox Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/seriouseatsbannerremover/), or [Github](https://github.com/DoronV/SeriousEatsBannerRemover).
